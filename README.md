# Windows 10 (UAP) SplitView Project Template
This project template is part of my [Developing for Windows 10](http://jamescroft.co.uk/category/blog/windows-10/) blog post series focussing on developing universal mobile applications for the Windows 10 platform.

This template has been designed to make it quicker and easier to get set up with developing a Windows 10 app using the new SplitView menu system for application navigation. 

## Features include
[The MVVM Light Toolkit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MvvmLightLibs/), designed to help developers get started with the Model-View-ViewModel pattern.

Custom SplitView menu control, designed to make it easier to create a robust menu system in a short amount of time. The menu comes with a preset layout which can be easily modified but has been designed to fit in with the design guidelines for Windows 10 application and should require minimal design changes to work with your application.

Navigation service, designed so that you can easily navigate the pages of your application in a simple way.
